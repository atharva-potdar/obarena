# Bot Runner

## Purpose

The executable that runs inside a Kubernetes Job spawned by bot-orchestrator. Performs two-phase testing against a contestant's submission: Phase 1 runs deterministic correctness validation sequences, Phase 2 runs a concurrent load test with multiple bot goroutines. Collects latency metrics via hdrhistogram, computes throughput, and publishes results to Redpanda `bot.metrics` topic.

## Position in Pipeline

Runs as a K8s Job in `bots` namespace. Connects to sandbox pod in `sandboxes` namespace via WebSocket → publishes to `bot.metrics` topic in Redpanda → consumed by telemetry-ingester.

## Event Contract

**Writes to:** `bot.metrics` (topic, sync produce)

## Operational Flow

### Phase 1: Correctness Validation (synchronous, ~5-10s)

1. Open WebSocket connection to `TARGET_ENDPOINT`
2. Run 5 deterministic test sequences sequentially, one at a time
3. Each sequence sends orders/cancels synchronously, waits for responses, asserts expected behavior
4. Each assertion checks: ack received, fill received with correct price/quantity, reject received, or orderbook state matches expected
5. Compute correctness score: `passed_assertions / total_assertions`
6. Close connection after each sequence

### Phase 2: Load Test (concurrent, duration-based)

1. Create N bot goroutines (default: 10 per bot, but configured by `NUM_BOTS` from bot-orchestrator)
2. Each bot:
   - Connects to sandbox WebSocket endpoint (retries on connection refused)
   - Signals readiness via `readyCh`
   - Loops through assigned sequence templates until duration expires
   - Tracks pending orders with 5-second garbage collection timeout
   - Enforces backpressure: max 20 in-flight orders per bot
3. Wait for 80% of bots to signal readiness (quorum) or 15-second warmup timeout
4. Start measurement timer
5. Wait for all bots to complete (duration expires or error)
6. Merge per-bot metrics into aggregate
7. Compute TPS: `orders_sent / elapsed_seconds`
8. Publish aggregate metrics to Redpanda `bot.metrics` (async produce)

## Endpoints

None. This is a batch executable, not a server.

## Configuration

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TARGET_ENDPOINT` | `ws://localhost:8080/stream` | WebSocket endpoint of sandbox |
| `NUM_BOTS` | `10` | Number of concurrent bot goroutines |
| `DURATION_SECONDS` | `30` | Load test duration |
| `TEAM_NAME` | `unknown` | Team display name |
| `TEST_RUN_ID` | *(empty)* | Submission ID for publishing |
| `REDPANDA_BROKERS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated broker list (empty = skip publish) |

## Correctness Sequences (Phase 1)

Five sequences run synchronously, each testing a specific aspect of orderbook behavior:

### 1. `cx_basic_match`
- Place buy limit order → verify 1 bid level on orderbook
- Place sell limit order at same price → verify fill at correct price/quantity, empty orderbook

### 2. `cx_priority_fill`
- Place buy at price P (lower) → verify 1 bid
- Place buy at price P+1 (higher) → verify 2 bids
- Place sell at price P for 10 units → verify fill at P+1 (price priority), empty orderbook

### 3. `cx_partial_fill`
- Place buy for 10 → verify 1 bid
- Place sell for 3 → verify partial fill (3 units), 1 bid remaining
- Cancel remaining bid → verify empty orderbook

### 4. `cx_cancel`
- Place buy → verify 1 bid
- Cancel buy → verify empty orderbook
- Place sell → verify 1 ask (no match since book is empty)
- Cancel sell → verify empty orderbook

### 5. `cx_reject_market_no_liquidity`
- Place market sell on empty book → verify reject with `no_liquidity` reason

Total: 33 assertions across all 5 sequences.

## Load Test Sequences (Phase 2)

Each bot is assigned one of three sequence types (based on bot ID):

### `basic_match`
- Place buy limit at base price, quantity 10
- Place sell limit at same price, quantity 10
- Expected: immediate fill

### `partial_fill_ladder`
- Place 3 buy limits at prices P, P-1, P-2 (quantity 5 each)
- Place market sell for 15 units
- Expected: sweep all 3 bid levels

### `cancel_correctness`
- Place buy limit, cancel it
- Place sell limit, cancel it
- Tests cancel path under load

Each bot uses a unique price band: `base_price = (bot_id + 1) * 1000`. Bands are 1000 units apart so that ladder sequences never overlap between bots.

## Metrics Collection

- **Ack latency**: hdrhistogram (range: 1µs to 60s, 3 significant figures)
- **Fill latency**: hdrhistogram (same range)
- **TPS**: `orders_sent / duration_seconds`
- **Stale orders**: tracked on read errors, write errors, and 5-second pending order timeout (cleaned up every 2 seconds)
- **Backpressure**: max 20 in-flight orders per bot; sleeps 1ms when exceeded

## Kafka Publish Flow

- Uses sync produce (`client.ProduceSync()`) — blocks until each record is acknowledged
- Only publishes if `TEST_RUN_ID` is non-empty and `REDPANDA_BROKERS` is configured
- Key: `submission_id`
- Client flushed before process exit

## TODO

- Kafka publish uses `ProduceSync()` which blocks on each record — should switch to async `Produce()` with callback so slow Redpanda doesn't delay process exit.

## Constraints

- Runs as a K8s Job (not a long-running service)
- Phase 1 always runs first, regardless of Phase 2 configuration
- Each bot goroutine maintains its own WebSocket connection
- Pending orders older than 5 seconds are garbage-collected and counted as stale orders
- Backpressure limit: 20 in-flight orders per bot
- If `REDPANDA_BROKERS` is empty, metrics are not published (local testing mode)
